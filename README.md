# HSAT1A-transcript-analysis
Analysis of HSAT1A based transcripts obtained from RACE-seq.

Diversity study of cluster groups of HSAT1A transcripts
- The file required for the R-script is "clusters_cut_total_count.txt".

Representation of the Sequence Logo of cluster 19
- For this R-script the file "cluster_19_alignment.txt" is required, which contains the sequences left aligned.

Merged alignment of the HSAT1A monomer sequence and the detected motifs sequences in each cluster group
-  The files used for this process with the NCBI Genome Workbench were "hsat1a_monomer.fasta" and "cluster_groups_cut_nummot6_tilesize7_motif_above50seq_corrected.fasta".
